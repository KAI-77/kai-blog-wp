# Auto Blog Demo

**Auto Blog Demo** is a WordPress plugin I built to automatically generate draft blog posts with topic-based content and images. It's designed to save time and make content creation easy, especially if you want to populate your WordPress site with realistic-looking posts for testing or demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Select from multiple topics: **Coloring, DIY, Art, Recipes, Fitness, Travel, Tech**.
- Generate **single or multiple posts** with a click.
- Randomly picks a **title** and corresponding **paragraphs** that flow together naturally.
- Attaches **main images and extra images** for visual appeal.
- Sets posts to **Blog category**, assigns **tags**, and adds a **summary** automatically.
- Draft posts are ready to **preview** before publishing.
- Configure how many **paragraphs per post** via the **Settings page**.
- Optionally enable or disable **image attachments** via the **Settings page**.
- Lightweight, secure, and easy to use with **nonce verification**.

- Images are attached only if enabled in **Settings**.
- Designed for **demonstration or testing purposes**; tweak the content arrays to suit your actual site needs.
